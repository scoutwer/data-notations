## 4. Convert Markdown Document to HTML

1. The markdown document can be easily converted to other formats, such as HTML. There are online converters available on the Internet.

    Find an online converter on the Internet that can convert markdown documents to HTML.

1. Convert all previously created MD documents to HTML. Download and save the HTML documents to your repository.
